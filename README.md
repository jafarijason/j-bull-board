# j-bull-board

## Overview

This package is a fork of [bull-board](https://github.com/felixmosh/bull-board). The original project is a popular tool for monitoring and managing Bull queues.

## Why This Fork?

I created this fork to reuse some UI components from the original project and adapt them for [your specific use case, e.g., custom integrations, additional features, etc.].
